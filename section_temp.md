Guoguang Liu, a well-known economist at CASS, pointed out that the fact that SOEs have been receiving differential rents by occupying monopolistic positions in key sectors is exactly in accordance with economic theories that support public appropriation of differential rents. For strategic sectors with key importance for national security and with natural monopolistic power, the issue at stake is not the exis- tence of monopoly, but rather who controls it (G. Liu, 2007; 2010).

Fourth, the claim that the state-owned economy is inefficient is false. Nowadays, the claim of low efficiency in the state-owned economy has been widely accepted. It is based on two core ideas: first, with- out clearly defined property right, SOEs are bound to suffer from principal-agent and free-riding problems; and, second, with only loosely binding budget constraints, managers of SOEs will make inef- ficient decisions. Fusheng Xie argues that these problems also exist in capitalist firms, and that they are inevitable under the social division of labor in a market economy (Xie, 2010). Guoguang Liu pointed out that the state-owned economy, compared with the private economy, had undoubted clear-cut advantages in improving macroeconomic performance. The state-owned economy can better promote eco- nomic growth and provide employment insurance and social welfare. The incentive and budget-constraint problems can be solved in the state-owned economy, just as in the private economy. The fall in the profitability of SOEs due to the high cost they have taken on in the process of social reform is temporary and can be reversed by policy, without changing ownership structure (G. Liu, 2007).

Moreover, the shift toward private ownership is the root cause of China's rising income inequality. The rightist elites attribute the widen- ing income gap in China to the birth of an elite class in monopolistic SOEs. This claim is somewhat widely accepted by the public; Guoguang Liu, however, argued that though it is undeniable that a special class did exist in the state-owned economy, the problem itself resulted from the transition to a market economy, rather than from factors inherent in the development of the state-owned economy as such. Wide income gaps were rare in the period of planned economy, but became prevalent exactly under the influence of neoliberal ideology and policies, especially due to the withdrawal of state supervision after China's tax reform in 1994. In the transition from planning to markets, some SOE managers first messed up enterprises under their management and then transferred state-owned wealth into pri- vate wealth through corrupt insider operations. An "unholy alliance" of SOE managers and some party and state leaders has generated huge benefits from fraudulent privatization of SOEs at the expense of workers (G. Liu, 2007). In addition, almost all of the leftist scholars attribute the inequality in chuci fenpei- namely, income distribution through the market-to capital-labor relations or the disparity in wealth owned by different classes. With the expansion of the private economy, it is expected that capital gains will rise at the expense of labor income, which is ultimately responsible for the rising income inequality in China.

Fifth, China's socialist market economy should retain public own- ership as the pillar while incorporating the development of multiple economic forms. Zhiyuan Cui, a leading scholar of China's New Left from Tsinghua University, argued that the co-development of state- owned and private enterprises in a mutually beneficial way is a more accurate description of the reality than the expression guojinmintui. Inspired by British liberal socialist James Meade, Cui took the ongoing "Chongqing Model"I as a prominent example of co-development, and argued that it would promote efficiency in all sectors of the economy, because the retained or added value of state-owned assets tended to relieve the over-dependence on tax revenue and national debt, which encouraged people to start business and create wealth (Cui, 2010). Yu Zhang also stated that the rise of the private economy and the retreat of the state economy contradicted China's basic economic system and the goal of SOE reform. The current economic problem is not monopoly, but the relative small scale of enterprises, the structural seg- mentation within industries, and the lack of international competitive- ness. The increasing concentration of capital in some key sectors and the strengthening of SOEs are necessary for coping with the challenge  of global competition and to protect national economic security. In those sectors specifically related to Chinese security, publicly owned enterprises represent social interest and implement national strate- gies better than private enterprises do (Y. Zhang, 2010a). Other leftist scholars, Guoguang Liu for instance, agreed on the general policy of taking public ownership as the pillar, keeping the dominant role of the state-owned economy, while encouraging the development of non-state-owned economy, including the private sector. But he also argued that the currently emerging problem is whether or not the share of public ownership had fallen to a critical point threatening China's socialist system. In addition, it is argued that the goal to ensure, realize and develop social justice and stability should be integrated with the development of the state-owned economy. Therefore, both central and local governments should take charge of strengthening several key SOEs. More importantly, all decisions on SOE reform should be monitored and supervised by national congresses at all levels and incorporate more public participation. China should utilize the flexibility of the private economy to facilitate the development of social productivity, but must also limit its exploitative nature and guide its developmental direction (G. Liu, 2007).

 > 1 This model is named after a series of policies adopted in the City of Chongqing since 2001. Its main contents are: first, government improves the profitability of SOEs in order to in- crease public finance revenues, through which the government can help to build a better economic environment for both SOEs and non-SOEs; second, the government can provide better public services and also reduce income inequality by offering subsidies to the poor, especially the peasants. More details will be given in the text below.

 Sixth, raising a false alarm about guojinmintuireflects a step toward continued privatization and the eventual abolition of the socialist sys- tem. The sharp debate since 2007 around guojinmintui is not confined to academia, and it does not aim at improving the socialist market economy. As Yu Zhang pointed out, it manifests the underlying class positions. Rightist elites usually put forward contradictory arguments: if SOEs do not perform well, this is said to be due to presumed low efficiency; if they perform well, it is because of the monopoly position they occupy. The not-yet-marketized SOEs are bound to be incompat- ible with market economy, while once they enter the market, they are criticized as competing with "people's interests." The low wages of managers in SOEs are said to be a symbol of inadequate incentives, while high wages are criticized as squeezing public interests and wid- ening the income gap. Acquisitions of SOEs by private enterprises are labeled as an achievement of reform, while acquisitions of private enterprises by SOEs are seen as a failure of reform. If the SOEs do not expand, they are claimed to be incapable of generating enough motivation; once they do expand, they are accused of crowding out the growth of the private economy. In sum, the rightists' criticisms are  rather simple: everything privately owned is good, while everything owned by the state is evil. No wonder for them that guojinmintui is not acceptable at all, while the opposite is more than welcome (Y. Zhang, 2010a). As Rui Liu pointed out, the essence underlying the debate over guojinmintui is whether China should continue adhering to SOEs, macroeconomic control, and promoting and perfecting the reform of the market economy based on her own conditions (R. Liu, 2010). Xiaolin Xia criticized the rightist elites' advocacy of the com- prehensive retreat of SOEs from both competitive and monopolistic sectors as exactly following the principle of privatization- the guiding ideology of the"Washington Consensus"(Xia, 2010). Xincheng Zhou reminded people to be aware of the political goal of the opponents of guojinmintui, which is to replace public ownership with private owner- ship as the pillar of the national economy. In this sense, the debate directly relates to the prospect and fate of China's social develop- ment, particularly whether China should and can adhere to socialism (Zhou, 2010). As clearly stated by Zhaoyong Xue, the opposition to guojinmintui goes against the Chinese constitution and the socialist road. The real intention is to speak for the capitalist class, abandon "Mao Zedong Thought" and the leadership of the CPC, depart from socialism and push China further onto a capitalist road (Xue, 2010).
